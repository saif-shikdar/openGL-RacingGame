As you can see, the textures (extracted from PS3) have some "weird" naming, like ds_speedup_cs.bmp or ds_speedup_ne.bmp

I think that the last letters before the extension are refered to this "naming".

C= Color
S= Specular
N= Normal map
E= Emissive

I got the results on the image in ue4 using this node links:

C = Diffuse
S = Specular, Metallic, Ambient Oclussion
N = Normal Map
E = Alpha node + color nodes and intensity to Emmisive color
